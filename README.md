# Scrabber-Helper
Given a set of characters, the program will most efficiently( in O(T) time where O(T) is the number of characters of the word) find the words that will produce the highest score

TODO List:
1) Make a nice UI
2) Allow scoring and match with existing words
3) Introduce actual scrabble game
